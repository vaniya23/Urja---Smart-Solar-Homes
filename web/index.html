        <div class="box-container">
    
            <h3>What is the meaning of Solar Subsidy?</h3>
            <p>We know that Solar Energy is the free & clean energy and it reduces the dependency of natural resources, 
                such as Water and Coal. Government wants to install solar power in every house through which each home&apos;s 
                roof will produce self-energy. Government supports financially to install solar power in residential homes, 
                thus providing Solar Subsidies.</p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Why Government gives Solar Subsidy?</h3>
            <p>India had target to install 40GW solar panels at residentail home buildings, but India has achived only 5GW till 2021. 
                Indian Goverment has set the target of 280GW solar panels by 2030 which means, 10GW solar panels should be installed every year. 
                Government has taken new intitives to install solar panels at homes, such as any customer can install solar panels by any solar
                dealer / distributors / company, installers and after installing they will have to  send solar panel installation photo to the nearest 
                electricity board and apply for solar subsidy.</p>
    
        </div>

        <h1 class="heading">Subsidy Merits<h1>
    
        <div class="box-container">
    
                <h3>Customer Benefits</h3>

                <p>The subsidy is only available for Residential Homes (Individual Homes & Big Apartments), not commercial and 
                    industrial sectors. A solar subsidy is only available on Grid Connected Solar System (Without Battery System). 
                    As installing a solar system is a huge investment, the financial assistance motivates people to invest and 
                    takes some burden off their shoulders.</p>

                <img src="images\table.PNG" alt="">

                <p>
                    Homeowners can only install a solar system and claim subsidy through the state DISCOM. They will have to share 
                    customer details and register the nearest channel partner.
                    If you install solar system though subsidy scheme, the solar installation company will provide 5 years of 
                    performance warranty, then after you are self responsible for your solar system.
                    This subsidy is not available for commercial and industrial customers because they can avail other benefits 
                    like accelerated depreciation, tax holidays, excise duty exemptions. 
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3>Channel Partner Benefits</h3>

                <p>Channel Partners benefit from a larger customer base and more business. It is difficult for a common person 
                   to figure out the processes of getting the subsidy though they very much desire it. It is now that the channel 
                   partner comes into the picture. They try to work with the customer and the government departments and expedite 
                   the process of getting a subsidy for the customer.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>DISCOMS Benefits</h3>

                <p>Power consumption demands reduce in residential sectors and they can give more in commercial area. 
                    We know that Commercial areas need more electricity than residential.

                The customers will be happy as they will get their financial aid, the channel partner will be happy as it will get 
                a new customer and the government will be happy too as it will get one step closer to its solar panel
                installation target. </p>
